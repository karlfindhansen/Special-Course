The GMB product consists of two different data sets. 1.) Mass change time series for the entire Greenland Ice Sheet and different drainage basins (2002-04 ‒ 2024-05).
2.) Gridded mass change trends over different 5-year periods between 2003 and 2023.

Basin definitions and further data descriptions can be found in the Algorithm Theoretical Baseline Document (ST-DTU-ESA-GISCCI+-ATBD-001_v1.0_final.pdf) and the Product Specification Document (ST-DTU-ESA-GISCCI-PSD-001_v2.3.pdf) which are provided on the project website http://esa-icesheets-greenland-cci.org.
